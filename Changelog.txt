- Save Preset actually works
	-- This functions by itterating across every sound file saved to the sound file array, and writing its value to a text file and a "," after every entry. On that same file, it also writes the content of the button.text(s) to the same file, also appended with a ","
- Load Preset no longer crashes, it just plain doesn't work. Progress!
