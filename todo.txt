TODO:
1: Create all TODO: Catch Error catches
2: Spruce up UI
3: Potentially connect Soundboard to Discord Bot to play SFX through?
4: Clean up code
5: Multithread App?
6: Improve adding sound file system. Potentially allow multiple files to be selected at a time?
7: Finish creating load presets


KNOWN BUGS:
- No Error catching of any sort
- Potentially saving a preset that does not have all 20 buttons full may likely not save properly, or load properly (when that works)
